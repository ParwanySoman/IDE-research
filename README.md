## _Pro's_


 
 - ##### The speed

	Sublime editor is known for its speed. It gives you very fast reactions. 



- #####  The ease of use
	It can be used in different program languages, especially in Java, PHP, CSS and Javascript, it will always work in a stable and fast way. Sublime Text Editor provides all the necessary functions, allowing the programmer to write and edit files with the source code efficiently.

- ##### Free packet
	The most beautiful thing about Sublime Text Editor is that everyone can use it, because there is a free version. It isn't much different than the premium version. 

## _Con's_

- ##### Nagging pop up for payment
	It might be annoying that every time you save a file, there is a pop-up window appearing that you are using a free version and there is a possibility to pay them to support their development. 

- ##### Errors
	You may have errors when downloading a plugin that your download was not made. So you have to close the editor, reopen it and try to download again so that the download can be made.

- ##### The price
	The pricing can be made a little more economic for developers who are on a tight budget for the development of projects. If the team manages to reduce the pricing , a lot of developer folks out there may get onboard the 'Sublime' journey. 

`I chose this IDE because I have read it is the most fitted to use when you are a beginner.`
